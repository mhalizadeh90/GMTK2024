## [GMTK 2024 Game Jam Project](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024)

### Overview
This repository is for the development of our GMTK 2024 Game Jam.

### Theme: Built to Scale
Create a game that revolves around size and dimension. Explore the extremes: tiny, microscopic worlds or colossal, cosmic landscapes. Experiment with scaling objects up or down like growth, shrinkage, and the interplay between big and small.
